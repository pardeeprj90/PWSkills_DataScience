    "### Who developed Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, designed Python as a general-purpose programming language with a focus on readability and simplicity. He released the first version of Python (Python 0.9.0) in February 1991."

    "### 2. Which type of Programming does Python support? \n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports multiple programming paradigms, making it a versatile language. It primarily supports the following programming paradigms:\n",
    "1. Procedural Programming: Python allows you to write programs in a procedural style, where you organize code into functions and procedures that manipulate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Python has extensive support for object-oriented programming. You can define classes and objects, encapsulate data, and use inheritance and polymorphism to create reusable and modular code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Functional Programming: Python supports functional programming concepts, such as first-class functions, higher-order functions, and lambda expressions. It allows you to write code in a functional style, where functions are treated as first-class objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Imperative Programming: Python supports imperative programming, where you write code that specifies a sequence of statements to be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Event-Driven Programming: Python provides libraries and frameworks for event-driven programming, allowing you to write code that responds to events and triggers specific actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Metaprogramming: Python offers metaprogramming capabilities, allowing you to modify or generate code dynamically during runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's flexibility in supporting different programming paradigms is one of its strengths, as it enables developers to choose the most suitable approach for their specific use cases."

    "\n",

    "### 5) Is Python code compiled or interpreted? \n",
    "Python is an interpreted programming language. When you run a Python program, the Python interpreter reads and executes the code line by line, without prior compilation into machine code.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Python does include a compilation step that occurs behind the scenes. When you execute a Python script or module, the Python interpreter first translates the source code into an intermediate representation called bytecode. This bytecode is then executed by the interpreter's runtime environment."

    "6.4) Class Definitions: \n",
