    "### Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database management system that is designed for storing and managing unstructured or semi-structured data. MongoDB uses a document-based data model, where data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas. It is known for its scalability, flexibility, and ease of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-Relational Databases:**\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are a category of database systems that are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data. Unlike traditional relational databases, which use a tabular structure with predefined schemas, non-relational databases use flexible data models that can accommodate various types of data without rigid schema requirements. Non-relational databases are often preferred for their scalability, flexibility, and performance in handling large volumes of data and high-speed transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenarios where MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases:**\n",
    "1. **Unstructured or Semi-Structured Data:** MongoDB is well-suited for storing and managing unstructured or semi-structured data, such as JSON documents, log files, sensor data, social media data, etc. It provides flexibility in data modeling, allowing developers to store data in a format that best fits the application's needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Agile Development:** MongoDB's dynamic schema allows for agile development and iterative changes to the data model without requiring schema migrations. This flexibility is beneficial for rapidly evolving applications and projects with changing requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scalability:** MongoDB is designed for horizontal scalability, making it suitable for distributed architectures and handling large volumes of data. It supports sharding, replication, and automatic failover, enabling seamless scalability as the application grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **High Performance:** MongoDB's document-based data model and indexing capabilities provide high performance for read and write operations, especially for use cases requiring real-time data processing, analytics, and caching.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Cloud-Native Applications:** MongoDB is often preferred for cloud-native applications and microservices architectures due to its compatibility with cloud platforms, ease of deployment, and support for containerization.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Document-Oriented Applications:** MongoDB is a natural fit for document-oriented applications, where data is stored and queried as JSON-like documents. It supports complex queries, indexing, and aggregation operations on nested data structures within documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where flexibility, scalability, agility, and performance are key requirements, especially for applications dealing with unstructured or semi-structured data and undergoing rapid development or growth."

    "   - It provides efficient storage and retrieval of data, making it suitable for real-time applications and high-speed data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Rich Query Language:**\n",
    "   - MongoDB provides a powerful and expressive query language that supports a wide range of operations, including CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), aggregation, sorting, filtering, and geospatial queries.\n",
    "   - It supports both ad-hoc queries and prepared queries, allowing for flexible querying of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Indexing and Aggregation:**\n",
    "   - MongoDB supports indexing of fields to improve query performance and enforce uniqueness constraints.\n",
    "   - It also provides aggregation pipelines, which allow you to perform complex data transformations, grouping, filtering, and analysis operations on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Automatic Failover and Replication:**\n",
    "   - MongoDB supports automatic failover and replica sets, which provide data redundancy, fault tolerance, and high availability.\n",
    "   - Replica sets consist of multiple nodes, with one primary node and one or more secondary nodes that replicate data from the primary node.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Security:**\n",
    "   - MongoDB provides robust security features, including authentication, authorization, encryption, and auditing.\n",
    "   - It supports role-based access control (RBAC) and fine-grained access control, allowing you to control access to databases and collections at a granular level.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Flexible Deployment Options:**\n",
    "   - MongoDB can be deployed on-premises, in the cloud, or in hybrid environments.\n",
    "   - It supports various deployment options, including standalone servers, replica sets, sharded clusters, and managed cloud services.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Q7. Explain why delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() is used.\n",
    "In MongoDB, `delete_one()`, `delete_many()`, and `drop()` are methods used to remove documents or collections from the database. Each method serves a different purpose and allows for different levels of granularity in deleting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **delete_one() Method:**\n",
    "   - `delete_one()` method is used to delete a single document that matches the specified criteria.\n",
    "   - It removes the first document that matches the filter criteria.\n",
    "   - If multiple documents match the filter, only the first one encountered is deleted.\n",
    "   - Syntax:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     collection.delete_one(filter)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # Delete the document with name \"John\"\n",
    "     collection.delete_one({\"name\": \"John\"})\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **delete_many() Method:**\n",
    "   - `delete_many()` method is used to delete multiple documents that match the specified criteria.\n",
    "   - It removes all documents that match the filter criteria.\n",
    "   - Syntax:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     collection.delete_many(filter)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # Delete all documents where age is greater than 30\n",
    "     collection.delete_many({\"age\": {\"$gt\": 30}})\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **drop() Method:**\n",
    "   - `drop()` method is used to remove an entire collection from the database.\n",
    "   - It deletes the entire collection along with all its documents.\n",
    "   - Syntax:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     collection.drop()\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # Drop the collection named \"customers\"\n",
    "     collection.drop()\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases:\n",
    "- `delete_one()` and `delete_many()` are used when you want to remove specific documents from a collection based on certain criteria.\n",
    "- `drop()` is used when you want to remove an entire collection from the database, typically when you no longer need the collection or want to clean up the database."
