    "### Q1. What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is the method of hiding the unwanted information. We can implement abstraction using abstract class. An abstract class can be considered a blueprint for other classes. It allows us to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class.An abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation.\n",
    "By default, Python does not provide abstract classes. Python comes with a module that provides the base for defining Abstract Base classes(ABC) and that module name is ABC. ABC works by decorating methods of the base class as an abstract and then registering concrete classes as implementations of the abstract base. A method becomes abstract when decorated with the keyword @abstractmethod.  "

    "In Python, achieving data abstraction involves encapsulating data within classes and providing a clear and simple interface for working with that data. Here's how you can do it in Python, using simpler language:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Class**: Define a class to represent the data or an object. This class acts as a container for the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use Private Variables**: Inside the class, use private variables by prefixing their names with double underscores (e.g., `__data`). This makes the variables inaccessible from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Provide Public Methods**: Create methods (functions) within the class to access and modify the private data. These methods are like \"getters\" to see the data and \"setters\" to change the data. They provide a simple way to interact with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Simplify Access**: Ensure that the methods you provide are easy to understand and use. This way, users of your class don't need to know the internal details of the data; they just work with the methods you've defined."
