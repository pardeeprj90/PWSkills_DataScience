    "### Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When an exception occurs, the interpreter interrupts the normal execution of the program and jumps to a special code block known as an exception handler. Exception handling allows the program to deal with unexpected situations gracefully rather than crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Difference between Exceptions and Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions: These occur during the runtime of a program and are raised when the interpreter encounters an error in the program logic or when an external event occurs that disrupts the normal flow.\n",
    "Examples: ZeroDivisionError, FileNotFoundError, TypeError, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax Errors: These occur during the parsing phase, before the program is executed. They are caused by errors in the syntax of the code.\n",
    "Examples: Misspelled keywords, missing colons, incorrect indentation, etc"

    "### Q2.  What happens when an exception is not handled? explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is not handled in a Python program, it leads to the termination of the program's normal execution, and an error message known as a traceback is displayed. The traceback provides information about the type of exception that occurred, the location in the code where the exception occurred, and the sequence of function calls that led to the exception."

These exceptions are created to handle specific error conditions that are not adequately represented by the built-in exception classes. By defining custom exceptions, programmers can create a more meaningful and structured way to handle application-specific errors."
